def distance_corr(X, Y):
    """
    Computes the distance correlation between X and Y.
    Taken from pypi package dcor based on the paper:
    *Measuring and testing dependence by correlation of distances*
    by GÃ¡bor et Al (2007)
    Parameters
    ----------
    X : numpy array like object where the rows correspond to the samples
        and the columns to features.

    Y : numpy array like, of same size as X and one single output.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy array of size the number of input features of X
    which holds the distance correlation between each feature
    and Y.
